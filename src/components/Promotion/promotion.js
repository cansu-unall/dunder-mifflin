           <p>Dunder Mifflin is committed to improving the environment. That's why we plant a tree for each and every metric ton of paper that we ship. We look at it as an investment in the future because without trees, we have no paper and without paper, we have no business.
            At all of our branches, we've encouraged our employees to think about the environment. In Albany, we have a full-scale printer-ink recycling program in effect. In Camden, employees have adopted their very own stretch of highway. Even our Scranton branch has gotten in on the action with a "one cup per day" policy at their water cooler. Around the company, Dunder Mifflin employees are making a difference and we're proud of that.
            Just because we're a paper company, it doesn't mean we're not as green as everyone else. Join us as we try to make the world a better place while not simultaneously running us out of our own business.
